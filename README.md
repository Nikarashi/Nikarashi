# Welcome! I'm Nikita ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer working on practical ML projects â€” from data preparation and model training to deployment and evaluation. My main interests include deep learning, NLP, and applied ML systems.

I take part in hackathons, write technical articles, and enjoy building things from scratch. Outside of work, I train in powerlifting â€” it keeps me focused, disciplined, and motivated.
